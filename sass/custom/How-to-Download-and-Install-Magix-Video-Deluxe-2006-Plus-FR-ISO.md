Once you find the download link, click on it and save the ISO file to your computer. The file size is about 1.5 GB, so it may take some time depending on your internet speed. You can check the progress of the download in your browser or download manager.
 
## Step 2: Mount or burn the ISO file
 
After you have downloaded the ISO file, you need to mount it or burn it to a disc. Mounting means creating a virtual disc drive on your computer that can read the ISO file as if it were a real disc. Burning means writing the ISO file to a blank CD or DVD that you can insert into your disc drive.

- **Windows Explorer:** If you have Windows 8 or later, you can mount the ISO file directly from Windows Explorer. Right-click on the ISO file and select Mount. The virtual disc drive will appear in This PC.
- **Burning software:** If you prefer to burn the ISO file to a physical disc, you can use any burning software that supports ISO files, such as Nero, ImgBurn, CDBurnerXP, or Windows Disc Image Burner.
